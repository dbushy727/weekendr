                            <h3 class="align-center">Unforgettable Weekend in Toronto</h3>
                            <p>Perched on the banks of the beautiful Lake Ontario, Toronto is a great city to lose yourself in for a weekend. The capital of Ontario, Toronto is a major metropolis. It is also the most populated city in Canada. This is where to come to sample a part of Canada that’s mostly filled with locals. </p>
                            <p>Toronto offers all of the delights that all large urban centers do: a great food scene, fun nightlife, and plenty of local culture. There is something for everyone to do. It’s short summer is the best time to visit, although there are plenty of great indoor activities if you happen to visit in the harsher winter months. Spend the perfect weekend here by sampling the great food scene, wandering the quirky neighborhoods, and exploring some indoor markets.</p>

                                    <h3>Friday Night</h3>
                                    <p>Start your trip with a visit to the Kensington Market neighborhood. Filled with colorful victorian homes, there is a laid-back, bohemian vibe to the restaurants, shops, and houses here. If there’s a photographer along for the trip, this is where to go for those perfect Toronto picture backdrops. </p>

                                    <p>When you work up an appetite, head to Grey Gardens for a delicious sit-down meal or Emporium Latino where you can get slow, cooked to order food in this old-school Latin Grocery setup. If you’re here on the last weekend of the month, bump this activity to Saturday when the streets are shut down to cars and vendors line the sidewalks.</p>
