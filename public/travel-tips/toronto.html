                            <h3 class="align-center">Unforgettable Weekend in Toronto</h3>
                            <p>Perched on the banks of the beautiful Lake Ontario, Toronto is a great city to lose yourself in for a weekend. The capital of Ontario, Toronto is a major metropolis. It is also the most populated city in Canada. This is where to come to sample a part of Canada that’s mostly filled with locals. </p>
                            <p>Toronto offers all of the delights that all large urban centers do: a great food scene, fun nightlife, and plenty of local culture. There is something for everyone to do. It’s short summer is the best time to visit, although there are plenty of great indoor activities if you happen to visit in the harsher winter months. Spend the perfect weekend here by sampling the great food scene, wandering the quirky neighborhoods, and exploring some indoor markets.</p>

                                    <h3>Friday Night</h3>
                                    <p>Start your trip with a visit to the Kensington Market neighborhood. Filled with colorful victorian homes, there is a laid-back, bohemian vibe to the restaurants, shops, and houses here. If there’s a photographer along for the trip, this is where to go for those perfect Toronto picture backdrops. </p>

                                    <p>When you work up an appetite, head to Grey Gardens for a delicious sit-down meal or Emporium Latino where you can get slow, cooked to order food in this old-school Latin Grocery setup. If you’re here on the last weekend of the month, bump this activity to Saturday when the streets are shut down to cars and vendors line the sidewalks.</p>

                                    <p>If the weather allows, take a ferrry over to the <a href="https://www.torontoisland.com/index.php">Toronto Islands</a>, a group of 15 islands in Lake Ontario that are connected by bridges and walkways. The islands have swimming beaches, canoe and kayak rentals, large fields perfect for picnicking, nature walks and even an amusement park. There’s enough to do to easily fill a whole day here, and bars and restaurants on site to make is possible.</p>

                                    <p>As an alternative, take the subway to <a href="http://casaloma.ca/about/">Casa Loma</a>, an early 20th Century castle that overlooks the city. The beautiful grounds, intricate rooms, and 800-foot underground tunnel are a great way to spend the day.</p>

                                    <h3>Saturday Night</h3>
                                    <p>After you’ve watched the sky turn dark, make sure you’re spruced up for dinner at Commander’s Palace. Commander’s serves classic Southern dishes in an old-school fine-dining setting that is worth going just for the experience, though the food is also great. Men take note - this is jacket required.</p>
                                    <p>Afterwards, keep the fine-dining experience going with a trip to the Maple Leaf after dinner, where jazz greats have been playing since it’s opening in 1974. The club is the longest standing live music operation in New Orleans. In a town with a reputation for producing some of the best music in the world, seeing a live band play here is a must.</p>

                                    <p>If you’re visiting in the Fall, see if the New Orleans Saints are in town. The city loves it’s football team and celebrates them in typical New Orleans fashion. The energy around the superdome is infectious. Make your way to the parking lots and bars around the stadium and soon you’ll likely be invited to a strangers pig roast or at least sharing a beer with many new friends. If you’re able to grab tickets it’s definitely worth going to a game.</p>
                                    <p>Any other time of year take a trip on the street car. It’s the cheapest way to get a tour of the city and makes for a fun ride. If you haven’t gotten a Po’ Boy fix yet, take this opportunity to take the street car out to Parkway Bakery in the Garden District.</p>
