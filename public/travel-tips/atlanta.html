                            <p>Atlanta has a complex past. Its position as a large city in the Southern U.S. made it a central point in both the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. </p>
                            <p>Now, it is a flourishing modern city with a vibrant nightlife, great music and food scene, and a thriving arts district. Atlanta is a large, sprawling, city that is recently getting the recognition it deserves for a great place to visit. The culture and overall vibe of Atlanta is, well, cool. The city is fun and hip, offering up more than enough to do to fill a weekend here.</p>
                            <p>The location makes it a great trip for outdoor lovers, it’s food and bar scene perfect for foodies, and it’s hip-hop culture ideal for music buffs. Here are 5 of the coolest things to do in Atlanta.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>What Atlanta proudly boasts as being one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in the world also happens to be one of the coolest things to do in Georgia’s capital city. The beltline is planned for 22 miles of trails, parks, and streetcars that connect 45 neighborhoods. While some parts of it are still under development, much of it is open and accessible year round. Tours, events, and fitness classes are available if you’re looking for something a bit more structured to do.</p>

                                    <p>Whether for food, shopping, or just to check it out, the Ponce City Market is well worth a visit. Newly opened in 2014, the market is housed in the old Sears building, which they revitalized and rebuilt to serve as apartments, offices, and commercial area for the market. There is a park at the center and the market makes a point to host community events year-round. They even put the huge rooftop to use, installing a mini-golf course, bars, and boardwalk games.</p>

                                    <p>The Chattahoochee River that cuts through downtown Atlanta is an easy spot for outdoor recreation. Its slow water flow makes it great for paddling and the surrounding area is rife with hiking and biking trails, some of which start in Atlanta neighborhoods. Try the East Palisades Trail for an easy, scenic walk that starts in Buckhead. If you have time to head outside of the city, Chattahoochee Bend River State Park is a beautiful setting with trails to explore and campgrounds to spend the night.</p>

                                    <p>Nestled inside Atlanta’s urban sprawl is a green, 200-acre oasis called Piedmont Park. The park itself is a cool thing to take in, with trails, a lake, and various viewpoints and sites within it. However, this is also where you will find the Atlanta Botanical Gardens, a trip worth making on its own. In the summer, Piedmont Park comes alive, hosting festivals and events and, with the opening of its public pool, offering a way to cool down in the heavy southern heat. </p>

                                    <p>One of Atlanta’s oldest neighborhoods also happens to be one of its coolest. Inman Park’s charming streets, lined with old Victorian homes, makes for the perfect place to spend time strolling around in a Southern neighborhood. When you get hungry, head on over to Krog Street Market for another one of Atlanta’s great food halls. With dozens of vendors, there is something to satisfy everyone’s cravings. If you’re not into visiting another market, the neighborhood is filled with great bars and restaurants, take your pick!</p>
